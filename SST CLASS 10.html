But is not as much tugh as it is made of as if the interest is developed in cach subject it is amde easy. this year a good for class 10 students as CBSE has reduced 30% syllabus, which hs made a sense of relief in all the students. this subjetc has been made that easy that you cant think of as all the notes are that much briefly and carefully made that you cant face any problem regarding any chapter. Thanks MK Academy teachers to made taht much precise and important notes. the only target of this website is to serve those students who find Social Science as the toughest subjects and score low marks. the humble request of mine is to briefly go through the notes and try to remember by giving time for learning that will help you at a great extent.
